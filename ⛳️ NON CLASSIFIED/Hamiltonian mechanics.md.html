<p>The states of a system of <a href="./Classical Mechanics.md.html">Classical Mechanics</a> are determined by generalized variables and their derivatives. In other words, we work in the tangent bundle of the <b>configuration space</b>, or the <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/GEOMETRY/jet bundle.md.html">jet bundle</a> of order 1. That is part of the formulation of <a href="./Lagrangian Mechanics.md.html">Lagrangian Mechanics</a>. The <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/Legendre transform.md.html">Legendre transform</a> allows us to move everything to the <b>cotangent bundle</b> (<b>phase space</b>). The states of the system are determined by the original variables and generalized momenta. It may seem cumbersome, but it has advantages in geometric interpretation. The systems (<a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/dynamical system.md.html">dynamical system</a>s) with this origin are called <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/classical Hamiltonian system.md.html">classical Hamiltonian system</a>s. Some of them are called <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/integrable systems.md.html">integrable systems</a>. Important example: <a href="./harmonic oscillator.md.html">harmonic oscillator</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Hamiltonian mechanics formalism can be summarized as follows (modified from "Review of CM and QM by <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/11/26/from-bose-einstein-condensates-to-the-nonlinear-schrodinger-equation/)"" target="_blank">Terence Tao</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. The physical system has a phase space $\Omega$ of states $\vec{x}$ (often parameterized by position variables $q$ and momentum variables $p$), which mathematically corresponds to a symplectic manifold with a <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/symplectic form.md.html">symplectic form</a> $\omega$ (e.g., $\omega = dp \wedge dq$ for position and momentum coordinates).</p>
<p>2. The complete state of the system at any time $t$ is represented by a point $\vec{x}(t)$ in the phase space $\Omega$.</p>
<p>3. Every physical observable $A$ (e.g., energy, momentum, position) is associated with a function $A$ that maps the phase space $\Omega$ to the range of the observable (e.g., for real observables, $A$ maps $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}$). Measuring the observable $A$ at time $t$ yields the measurement $A(\vec{x}(t))$.</p>
<p>4. The Hamiltonian $H: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a special observable that governs the evolution of the state $\vec{x}(t)$ over time through <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/Hamiltonian equations.md.html">Hamiltonian equations</a> of motion. In terms of position and momentum coordinates $\vec{x}(t) = (q_i(t), p_i(t))_{i=1}^n$, these equations are given by:</p>
$$
\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}, \quad \frac{\partial q_i}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}.
$$
<p>More abstractly, using the symplectic form $\omega$, the equations of motion can be written as:</p>
$$
\frac{\partial \vec{x}(t)}{\partial t} = -\nabla_\omega H(\vec{x}(t)), \quad (2)
$$
<p>where $\nabla_\omega H$ is the <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/Hamiltonian vector field.md.html">symplectic gradient</a> of $H$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hamilton's equations of motion can also be expressed in a dual form using observables $A$ as <b>Poisson's equations of motion</b>:</p>
$$
\frac{\partial A(\vec{x}(t))}{\partial t} = -\{H, A\}(\vec{x}(t)),
$$
<p>where $\{H,A\} = \nabla_\omega H \cdot \nabla A$ is the induced <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/Poisson bracket.md.html">Poisson bracket</a> (here we consider an arbitrary Riemannian metric defined on $\Omega$ in order to define $\nabla A$ and the dot product.  See <a href="./../☕REFLECTIONS/relation symplectic form and Riemannian metric.md.html">relation symplectic form and Riemannian metric</a>). In a more abstract form, Poisson's equation can be written as:</p>
$$
\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = -\{H,A\}, \quad (3)
$$
<p>where $\{H,A\}$ represents the Poisson bracket.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the formalism above, we assume the system is in a pure state at each time $t$, occupying a single point $\vec{x}(t)$ in phase space. However, mixed states can also be considered, where the state of the system at time $t$ is described by a <a href="./probability theory.md.html">probability distribution</a> $\rho(t,\vec{x})\, d\vec{x}$ on the phase space. Measuring an observable $A$ at time $t$ becomes a <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/random variable.md.html">random variable</a>, and its expectation $\langle A \rangle$ is given by:</p>
$$
\langle A \rangle(t) = \int_\Omega A(\vec{x}) \rho(t,\vec{x})\, d\vec{x}, \quad (4)
$$
<p>The equation of motion for a mixed state $\rho$ is given by the advection equation:</p>
$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \text{div}(\rho \nabla_\omega H)$$
<p>using the same vector field $-\nabla_\omega H$ as in equation (2). This equation can also be derived from equations (3), (4), and a duality argument.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pure states can be seen as a special case of mixed states, where the probability distribution $\rho(t,\vec{x})\, d\vec{x}$ is a <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/Dirac delta.md.html">Dirac delta</a> $\delta_{\vec{x}(t)}(\vec{x})$. Mixed states can be thought of as continuous averages of pure states, or equivalently, the space of mixed states is the convex hull of the space of pure states. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider a system of 2 particles with a joint phase space $\Omega = \Omega_1 \times \Omega_2$, where $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ are the individual one-particle phase spaces. A pure joint state is represented by a point $x = (\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$ in $\Omega$, where $\vec{x}_1$ and $\vec{x}_2$ represent the states of the first and second particles, respectively. If the joint Hamiltonian $H: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ splits as:</p>
$$
H(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) = H_1(\vec{x}_1) + H_2(\vec{x}_2),
$$
<p>then the equations of motion for the first and second particles are completely decoupled, with no interactions between them. However, in practice, the joint Hamiltonian contains coupling terms between $\vec{x}_1$ and $\vec{x}_2$ that prevent total decoupling. For instance, the joint Hamiltonian may be:</p>
$$
H(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) = \frac{|p_1|^2}{2m_1} + \frac{|p_2|^2}{2m_2} + V(q_1 - q_2),
$$
<p>where $\vec{x}_1 = (q_1, p_1)$ and $\vec{x}_2 = (q_2, p_2)$ are position and momentum coordinates, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are mass constants, and $V(q_1 - q_2)$ represents the interaction potential depending on the spatial separation $q_1 - q_2$ between the particles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Similarly, a mixed joint state is a joint probability distribution $\rho(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)\, d\vec{x}_1\, d\vec{x}_2$ on the product state space. To obtain the (mixed) state of an individual particle, we consider marginal distributions such as:</p>
$$
\rho_1(\vec{x}_1) = \int_{\Omega_2} \rho(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)\, d\vec{x}_2
$$
<p>for the first particle or</p>
$$
\rho_2(\vec{x}_2) = \int_{\Omega_1} \rho(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)\, d\vec{x}_1
$$
<p>for the second particle. For $N$-particle systems, if the joint distribution of $N$ distinct particles is given by $\rho(\vec{x}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}_N)\, d\vec{x}_1 \ldots d\vec{x}_N$, then the distribution of the first particle is:</p>
$$
\rho_1(\vec{x}_1) = \int_{\Omega_2 \times \ldots \times \Omega_N} \rho(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2, \ldots, \vec{x}_N)\, d\vec{x}_2 \ldots d\vec{x}_N,
$$
<p>and the distribution of the first two particles is:</p>
$$
\rho_{12}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) = \int_{\Omega_3 \times \ldots \times \Omega_N} \rho(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2, \ldots, \vec{x}_N)\, d\vec{x}_3 \ldots d\vec{x}_N,
$$
<p>and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A typical Hamiltonian for such systems can take the form:</p>
$$
H(\vec{x}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}_N) = \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{|p_j|^2}{2m_j} + \sum_{1 \leq j < k \leq N} V_{jk}(q_j - q_k),
$$
<p>which combines single-particle Hamiltonians $H_j$ and interaction perturbations. When momenta $p_j$ and masses $m_j$ are normalized to be of size $O(1)$ and the potential $V_{jk}$ has an average value (i.e., $L^1$ norm) of $O(1)$, the first sum has size $O(N)$ and the second sum has size $O(N^2)$. In order to balance the two components and obtain more interesting limiting dynamics as $N \rightarrow \infty$, we introduce a normalization factor of $\frac{1}{N}$ on the right-hand side, resulting in the Hamiltonian:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$H(\vec{x}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}_N) = \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{|p_j|^2}{2m_j} + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1 \leq j < k \leq N} V_{jk}(q_j - q_k).$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now consider a system of $N$ indistinguishable particles, where all the state spaces $\Omega_1 = \ldots = \Omega_N$ are identical, and observables (including the Hamiltonian) are symmetric functions of the product space $\Omega = \Omega_1^N$ (i.e., invariant under the action of the symmetric group $S_N$). In this case, we can average over the symmetric group (without affecting physical observables) and assume that all mixed states $\rho$ are also symmetric. However, this comes at the cost of mostly giving up pure states $(\vec{x}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}_N)$, as they are symmetric only in exceptional cases where $\vec{x}_1 = \ldots = \vec{x}_N$.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A typical example of a symmetric Hamiltonian is:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$H(\vec{x}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}_N) = \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{|p_j|^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1 \leq j < k \leq N} V(q_j - q_k),$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>where $V$ is an even function (implying all particles have the same individual Hamiltonian and interact with other particles using the same potential). In many physical systems, it is natural to consider short-range interaction potentials, where the interaction between $q_j$ and $q_k$ is localized to the region $q_j - q_k = O(r)$ for some small $r$. This is modeled by Hamiltonians of the form:</p>
<p></p>
$$H

(\vec{x}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}_N) = \sum_{j=1}^N H(\vec{x}_j) + \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1 \leq j < k \leq N} \frac{1}{r^d} V\left(\frac{\vec{x}_j - \vec{x}_k}{r}\right),$$
<p></p>
<p>where $d$ is the ambient dimension of each particle (typically 3 in physical models). The factor of $\frac{1}{r^d}$ normalizes the interaction potential's $L^1$ norm to be $O(1)$. An interesting limit arises when $r$ approaches zero as $N$ goes to infinity with $r = N^{-\beta}$, where $\beta$ is some power law. For example, one can consider $N$ particles of "radius" $r$ bouncing around in a box, which is a basic model for classical gases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A symmetric mixed state example is a factored state:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$$\rho(\vec{x}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}_N) = \rho_1(\vec{x}_1) \ldots \rho_1(\vec{x}_N),$$</p>
<p></p>
<p>where $\rho_1$ is a single-particle probability density function. In the absence of interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, the factored state property is preserved by Hamilton's equations of motion, with $\rho_1$ evolving according to the one-particle equation. However, with interactions, the factored nature may be lost over time.</p>

<h2 style="margin-left:0px;" id="Hamiltonian_vector_fields">Hamiltonian vector fields	</h2>
<p>See <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/Hamiltonian vector field.md.html">Hamiltonian vector field</a>s.</p>
<p><b>This <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/symplectic form.md.html">symplectic form</a> has a main use</b>: to convert the differential of the hamiltonian, $dH$, into a vector field called the <b>symplectic gradient</b>: the only vector field $X_H$ such that $\omega(X_H,-)=dH$. If we have also a <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/GEOMETRY/Riemannian metric.md.html">Riemannian metric</a> $g$, it turns out that this symplectic gradient and the usual gradient are orthogonal: remember that given a function $H$ the gradient is the only vector field $\nabla H$ such that $dH=g(\nabla H,-)$. Therefore</p>
$$
g(\nabla H, X_H)=dH(X_H)=\omega(X_H,X_H)=0
$$
<p>It's important to observe that:</p>
<p>1. $i_{X_H} \omega=dH$</p>
<p>2. $\mathcal{L}_{X_H} \omega=0$. It is proven by Cartan's formula.</p>
<p>3. $\mathcal{L}_{X_H}\omega^n=0$. This $2n$- form is a volume form. So the flow over the Hamiltonian vector field conserve the volume. This fact is known as <b>Liouville theorem</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More things about:</p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>$T^*Q$ is a space that represents the <b>states</b> of the system. The function $H: T^*Q \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ determines the <b>dynamic</b> of the system. $H$ produces a vector field, $X$, the symplectic gradient, that yields the dynamic itself. Its flow, $\phi$, is again the dynamic.</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>$X$ is tangent to hypersurfaces $H=cte$:</li></ul></p>
$$
 X(H)=dH(X)=i_X(\omega)(X)=0
$$
<p>(maybe with a minus sign?)</p>
<p></p>
<p>So $H$ is constant along the $\phi$ curves:</p>
$$
 X(H)=\frac{d}{dt}H\circ \phi
$$
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>The one-parameter group $\phi$ is the evolution of the system. This privileged parameter $t$ will be called <b>time</b>.</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>Imagine other function $F:T^*Q\mapsto \mathbb{R}$. Possibly you want to know how it changes with _time_. Fix a initial point $P$:</li></ul></p>
$$
 D=\frac{d}{dt}(F\circ \phi)=X(F)=dF(X)
$$
<p>But observe that if we take $Y$ such that $i_Y \omega=-dF$ then</p>
$$
 dF(X)=-i_Y \omega (X)=-\omega(Y,X)=
$$
$$
=\omega(X,Y)=i_X\omega(Y)=-dH(Y)=-Y(H)
$$
<p>So the interesting quantity $D$ can be computed in two ways</p>
$$
 X(F)=-Y(H)
$$
<p></p>
<p>This motivate a new definition. Remove, temporarily, the special paper to $H$. For the functions $F, H$ we define the <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/Poisson bracket.md.html">Poisson bracket</a>s as the new function:</p>
$$
 \{F,H\}=X(F)=-Y(H)=\omega(X,Y) 
$$
<p>It is satisfied:</p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>$\left\{q_{i}, p_{j}\right\}=\delta_{i j}$</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>Observe that if we leave a slot $\{-,H\}$ we have an operator that acts over functions. In fact, is the vector field $X$! So the Poisson bracket let us to find the symplectic gradient <b>directly</b>, without the use of $d$ and $\omega$. More explicitly</li></ul></p>
$$
X_f=\{-,f\}
$$
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>From $d\omega=0$ it can be deduced the Jacobi identity:</li></ul></p>
$$
 \{f,\{g, h\}\}=\{\{f, h\}, g\}+\{h,\{f, g\}\}
$$
<p>for any three functions $f, g, h$.</p>
<p>Leaving an slot instead of $f$ we get</p>
$$
 \{-,\{g,h\}\}=\left[ \{-,g\}, \{-,h\}\right]
$$
<p>expression that can be rewritten as</p>
$$
 X_{\{g,h\}}=[X_g,X_h]=X_{\omega(X_g,X_h)}
$$
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>Taking the Poisson bracket of any function with a moment $p_i$ gives us how the function varies along the associated coordinate $q_i$:</li></ul></p>
$$
 \{F,p_i\}=X_{p_i}(F)
$$
<p>but $X_{p_i}$ is just $\partial q_i$</p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>$\{f,g\}$ can be interpreted as the area of the paralelogram made of $X_f$ and $X_g$</li></ul></p>
$$
 \{f,g\}=X_g(f)=df(X_g)=\nabla f \cdot X_g
$$
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>Any function $f \in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(T^*Q)$ is called an <b>observable</b>. They constitute a commutative algebra that is, in fact, a <b>Poisson algebra</b> due to the existence of the Poisson bracket $\{-,-\}$. If you fix any $f\in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(T^*Q)$ then you get a one-parameter <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/local group of transformations.md.html">local group of transformations</a> for $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(T^*Q)$ in the following way.</li></ul></p>
<p>First, you have the vector field $X_f$ given by</p>

$$
<p>Then, the <a href="./../✏️ THEOREMS/DG/flow theorem for vector fields.md.html">flow theorem for vector fields</a> let you assure that there exists the local flow</p>

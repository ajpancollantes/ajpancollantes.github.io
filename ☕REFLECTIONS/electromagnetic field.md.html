<p>It is the fundamental notion for <a href="./../⛳️ NON CLASSIFIED/Optics.md.html">Optics</a>.</p>
<h3 style="margin-left:0px;" id="Electromagnetic_field">Electromagnetic field</h3>
<p>Electric and magnetic fields are connected by Maxwell's equations. They are a summary of a lot of relations worked out during the 19th century that explain how these fields evolve with time, one influenced by the other. This set of equations was a big achievement for science.</p>
$$
\begin{align}
\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_{0}} \\
\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{B} &= 0 \\
\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{E} &= -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \\
\vec{\nabla} \times \vec{B} &= \mu_{0} \vec{j} + \mu_{0} \varepsilon_{0} \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}
\end{align}
$$
<p></p>
<p>Here, $\rho$ and $j$ are data about the distribution and movement of the charges affecting the fields. See <a href="./../♾️ CONCEPTS/four-current.md.html">four-current</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, it was discovered by Lorentz that a particle with electric charge subjected to an electric field $E$ and a magnetic field $B$ experiences a force (Lorentz force law):</p>
$$
F = e[E + v \times B]
$$
<p>where $v$ is the speed of the particle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But there were two facts that led to a modification of all this stuff. </p>
<p>One was the development of Lagrangian mechanics. The perspective was changed: forces are not the fundamental objects that one acquires from experimentation; instead, the least action principle is the key. Physicists look for Lagrangians whose Euler-Lagrange equations explain the phenomena. Moreover, the evolution of the fields can be explained in a similar way, from a Lagrangian and the least action principle (classical field theory).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The other fact was the development of special relativity. All scientific laws have to be adapted to be Lorentz invariant, with this new paradigm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The result was that physicists realized the existence of two new objects, more fundamental than $E$ and $B$. One is the <b>vector potential</b> $A_{\mu}$ (a 1-form) and the other is <b>the electromagnetic tensor</b> $F_{\mu \nu}$ (a 2-form).</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The vector potential $A_{\mu}$</b>: When formulated in terms of $E$ and $B$ there is no way to express the dynamics of charged particles as an action principle. For that, the vector potential is essential. We invent an action that involves a mysterious $A_{\mu}$. Then we write the Euler-Lagrange equations and compare with Lorentz force law to obtain that we can define $A_{\mu}$ such that:</p>
$$
\vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t} + \vec{\nabla} A_{0}
$$
<p>and</p>
$$
\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A}
$$
<p>There is a point here. Is $A_{\mu}$ anything physical or is it only a mathematical trick to sum up electric and magnetic field? Both perspectives are valid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It turns out that the Lagrangian for the particle inside the electromagnetic field is</p>
$$
\mathcal{L} = -m \sqrt{1 - \dot{x}^{2}} + e A_{0}(t, x) + e \dot{X}^{p} A_{p}(t, x)
$$
<p>and the equation of motion, under special relativity, is</p>
$$
m \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\dot{X}_{p}}{\sqrt{1 - \dot{x}^{2}}} = e\left(\frac{\partial A_{0}}{\partial X^{p}} - \frac{\partial A_{p}}{\partial t}\right) + e \dot{X}^{n}\left(\frac{\partial A_{n}}{\partial X^{p}} - \frac{\partial A_{p}}{\partial X^{n}}\right)
$$
<p>or</p>
$$
m \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\dot{X}_{p}}{\sqrt{1 - \dot{x}^{2}}} = e(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})_{p}
$$
<p>It can be written in pure relativistic form (4-vectors) in the following way:</p>
$$
m \frac{d U_{\mu}}{d \tau} = e\left(\frac{\partial A_{\nu}}{\partial X^{\mu}} - \frac{\partial A_{\mu}}{\partial X^{\nu}}\right) U^{\nu}
$$
<p></p>
<p><b>The electromagnetic tensor</b>: On the other hand, the electromagnetic tensor is</p>
$$
F_{\mu \nu} = \frac{\partial A_{\nu}}{\partial X^{\mu}} - \frac{\partial A_{\mu}}{\partial X^{\nu}}
$$
<p>This tensor encodes $E$ and $B$:</p>
$$
F_{\mu \nu} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 0 & -E_{x} & -E_{y} & -E_{z} \\ +E_{x} & 0 & +B_{z} & -B_{y} \\ +E_{y} & -B_{z} & 0 & +B_{x} \\ +E_{z} & +B_{y} & -B_{x} & 0 \end{array} \right)
$$
<p>It lets express the equation of motion for the charged particle as</p>
$$
m \frac{d^{2} X_{\mu}}{d \tau^{2}} = e F_{\mu \nu} U^{\nu}
$$
<p>and Maxwell's equations get reduced to</p>
$$
\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{F} = 0, \quad \mathrm{d}^{*} \boldsymbol{F} = 4 \pi^{*} \boldsymbol{J}
$$
<p>or in index notation</p>
$$
\partial_{\mu} F_{\nu \sigma} + \partial_{\nu} F_{\sigma \mu} + \partial_{\sigma} F_{\mu \nu} = 0
$$
$$
\partial_{\nu} F^{\mu \nu} = J^{\mu}
$$
<p>or in <a href="./../⛳️ NON CLASSIFIED/Penrose abstract index notation.md.html">Penrose abstract index notation</a></p>
$$
\nabla_{[a} F_{b c]} = 0
$$
$$
\nabla_{a} F^{a b} = 4 \pi J^{b}
$$
<p></p>
<p>We can think that Maxwell's equations are the analogous of the equation of motion of a particle but for the electromagnetic field. So it would be great if they, instead of being obtained empirically (we postulate their existence from the experiments), they were derived from a Lagrangian (also postulated, of course) with the action principle (Euler-Lagrange). That would confer a more compact approach to electromagnetism, giving the same treatment to particles and fields.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first half of Maxwell's equations are deduced only from math. Susskind (Theoretical Minimum 3) calls it the Bianchi identity (page 300).</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the second half, the Lagrangian turns out to be</p>
<p></p>
$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}
$$
<p></p>
<p>when we are in the vacuum. Euler-Lagrange equations from here lead to </p>
<p></p>
$$
\partial_{\nu} F^{\mu \nu} = 0
$$
<p></p>
<p>It can be guessed that, if we have the moving charges in the ambient, the Lagrangian would be the same but with the additional term</p>
<p></p>
$$
J^{\mu}(x) A_{\mu}(x)
$$
<p></p>
<p>This modified Lagrangian leads to an action (that is gauge invariant) that yields the equation</p>
<p></p>
$$
\partial_{\nu} F^{\mu \nu} = J^{\mu}

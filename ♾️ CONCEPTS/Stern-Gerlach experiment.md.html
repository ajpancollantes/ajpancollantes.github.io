<h2 style="margin-left:0px;" id="Description">Description</h2>
<p>bla bla bla</p>
<p></p>
<h2 style="margin-left:0px;" id="Explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>Coming from <a href="./../⛳️ NON CLASSIFIED/probability theory.md.html#Text_2">probability theory#Text 2</a>.</p>
<p>Consider first a classical set up, and the we will <b>jump to the quantum behavior</b>. Nevertheless, the classical behavior would be valid, even in QM, for observables that are "totally independent" (own terminology), for example, $x$ position and $y$ position. I think the technical name is commuting observables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose that after measuring an electron with the first device we obtain $r$. Then we use the second one and obtain $b$. In a classical setup we would expect that if we use device 1 again, we obtain $r$ again, but this is not what happens with Stern-Gerlach devices. We obtain $r$ and $g$ with certain frequencies (although fixed).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The logical explanation (at least from the point of view of QM) is to accept that electron <b>is</b> in a certain state $\Psi \in \mathcal{H}_1$ before the use of any machine (see <a href="./quantum superposition.md.html">quantum superposition</a>). Until now, we have assumed that the vector in the Hilbert space encodes probabilities. But now we are saying that <b>the electron is the vector</b> (or, at least, a part of the electron). Every time we use a machine, the vector $\Psi$ <b>moves to a new location</b>. For example: we use machine 1 and get $r$ or $0'7$ (with certain probability), so the state vector has traveled to $r$. If we use machine 1 again we obtain the same result: probability of obtain $r$ again is the length of the projection of $r$ on $r$, that is, 1!! If we use machine 2, depending on the value obtained, the state vector travels to $b$ or $s$ but they are still inside $\mathcal{H}_1$. </p>
<p></p>
<p>That is, we have machines (or one machine with different positions) that extract information of the system. The system is codified in a Hilbert space and the machines in operators. Every operator has <b>privileged states</b> with good behavior respect to it (a "classic behavior" respect to it, we can say). That is the reason why we cannot consider any operator, but the corresponding to <a href="./Hermitian matrix.md.html">Hermitian matrices</a>. </p>
<p>If the system is in a "classical state" for the operator, the operator will only change the scale of the state vector, and the measurement arises when we check the length of the transformed vector</p>
$$
\langle r|F(r) \rangle.
$$
<p>If the system is in a "non-classical" state for this machine, it goes to the "most similar" classical state for the machine (not for sure, but with a probability that depends on the similitude), and then the above is applied.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can we find the expression of the privileged states of a machine with respect of the ones of the other? That is, who are $b$ and $s$ (canonical base for machine 2) in the canonical base of $\mathcal{H}_1$? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose the machines are $SG_z$ and $SG_x$ in the Stern-Gerlach experiments. According to the <b>measured probabilities</b> in <a href="./Stern-Gerlach experiment.md.html">Stern-Gerlach experiment</a> we could assign the coefficients:</p>
$$
b=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} r+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}g
$$
$$
s=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} r-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}g
$$
<p>The choice of the coefficients is arbitrary but subject to the measured probabilities. </p>
<p>Observe that, so far, we have no need of complex numbers. </p>
<p>Of course, the operator $SG_z$ has the matrix expression in "its associated basis" is (we are assuming now that the outputs are 1 and -1 instead of 0'7 and 1'8):</p>
$$
SG_z \equiv \begin{pmatrix}
1&0 \\ 
0& -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>What is the matrix expression for the $SG_x$ machine in this basis? Since $SG_x b=b$ and $SG_x s=-s$, solving a very easy linear system we find that</p>
$$
SG_x \equiv \begin{pmatrix}
0&1 \\ 
1& 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>But we can think like if we have an infinite number of machines $SG_{\theta}$. They are all the same that our original $SG_z$ but rotated an angle $\theta$ from the $z$ axis towards the $x$ axis. For the moment, we will be pretending that the universe is of dimension 2. With each of these machines we get two results, say $M$ and $B$, and <b>empirically</b> obtain that, once our system is in state $M$, $SG_z$ yields an expected value of $cos(\theta)$, what is reasonable even from the classical point of view. If we write $M=\alpha r +\beta g$ and $B=\gamma r+ \delta g$, since</p>
$$
\langle M |SG_z(M) \rangle=cos(\theta)
$$
<p>(expected value) and $M$ is normalized, i.e., </p>
$$
\langle M|M \rangle=1
$$
<p>we obtain </p>
$$
M=cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) r+ sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) g
$$
<p>In a similar way, since the expected value for $B$ is $-cos(\theta)$ and $M$ and $B$ must be orthogonal we can conclude</p>
$$
B=-sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) r+ cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) g
$$
<p>Solving a linear system we find the matrix for $SG_{\theta}$:</p>
$$
SG_{\theta} \equiv \begin{pmatrix}
cos(\theta)&sin(\theta) \\ 
sin(\theta)& -cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>So, in conclusion, we can assume that when we rotate the $SG_z$ machine an angle $\theta$ the well-behaved states are now</p>
<p></p>
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ 
sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) 
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
-sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ 
cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) 
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>that is, the privileged vectors are rotated an angle of $\theta/2$. Or we can interpret that if we rotate the system (our electron gun in state $r=\begin{pmatrix}1 \\0 \end{pmatrix}$) an angle of $-\theta$, we are putting the electron in a state </p>
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ 
-sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) 
\end{pmatrix} \in \mathcal{H}
$$
<p>And the operator goes from </p>
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1&0\\ 
0&-1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>to</p>
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\theta)&sin(\theta) \\ 
sin(\theta)& -cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>This <b>let us predict probabilities</b> in the <a href="./Stern-Gerlach experiment.md.html">Stern-Gerlach experiment</a>: what would be the probability of obtain such result if we turn the machine such angle? It is a numerical model for this family of Stern-Gerlach experiments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But we can think in it like a geometric model, too. The different directions of space (plane, in this case) are codified in the matrices $SG_{\theta}$: $SG_z$ would represent the unit vector along $z$ axis, and $SG_{\theta}$ is the result of a rotation of angle $\theta$.  And we are led to think that spin is an "internal object" inside the electron with a special kind of symmetry without counterpart in classical-macroscopic terms.  </p>
<p>(see section \textit{About spin})</p>
<p><img src="./../imagenes/Pasted image 20220619120550.png" style="width:80vw; border-radius: 3px;" ></p>
<p>So, what about our electron? After performing a rotation of angle $\theta$ the privileged states of the Hilbert space have rotated $\theta/2$ so we come back to the initial configuration after a $4\pi$ rotation. So we can say that electron has spin 1/2. It is a bit difficult to visualize but you can imagine an arrow with a flag attached in such a way that the flag turns half the angle of the arrow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, observe that the matrices </p>
$$ 
SG_z=\begin{pmatrix}
1&0 \\ 
0& -1
\end{pmatrix},\quad SG_x=\begin{pmatrix}
0&1 \\ 
1& 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>behaves like a orthogonal vector basis of $\mathbb{R}^2$. In fact</p>
$$
R^{\theta}(SG_z)=\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta)&-\sin(\theta) \\ 
sin(\theta)& cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix} \cdot\begin{pmatrix}
1&0 \\ 
0& -1
\end{pmatrix}=
$$
$$
=\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta)&\sin(\theta) \\ 
\sin(\theta)& -\cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix}=\cos(\theta) SG_z + \sin(\theta) SG_x
$$
<p>among other similarities. But the matrices product gives them an additional intrinsic algebra structure which the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$ lacks. What does it mean, geometrically? </p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a correspondence between the subalgebra generated by the matrices $\{SG_z, SG_x\}$ and the abstract <a href="./Clifford algebra.md.html">Clifford algebra</a> of dimension 2 and positive signature with orthonormal basis $\{e_1, e_2\}$. Since we know that in the Clifford algebra the even subalgebra acts over $\mathbb{R}^2$ like rotations (on the "sandwich way") we are led to think that internal states of the electron are elements of $\mathcal{G}_2^+$, that is, <a href="./spinors.md.html">spinors</a>. That is, the element </p>
$$
cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) 1 + sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) e_1 e_2 \in \textrm{Cl}_2(\mathbb{R})
$$
<p>is identified with the pair of elements of the Hilbert space</p>
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ 
sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) 
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
-sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ 
cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) 
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>One observation: the even subalgebra behaves like complex numbers. So the complex numbers have already entered the scene.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 style="margin-left:0px;" id="The_3-dimensional_space">The 3-dimensional space</h2>
<p>But the Universe is not planar, is 3D. What happens when we rotate the machine out of the $xz$-plane? Experiments show that the pure $y$ orientation of the machine ($SG_y$) yields a pair of states, call it <b>head</b> and <b>tail</b>, $h$ and $t$, with probabilities <b>similar to</b> those of the $SG_x$ ($b$ and $s$) when throwed through $SG_z$. But keep an eye: further experiments show that those <b>are not</b> the privileged states of $SG_x$. This cannot be, definitively, modelled if we stay with real numbers (see page <a href="./../☕REFLECTIONS/Why complex numbers in QM.md.html">Why complex numbers in QM</a>).</p>
<p>We can solve this problem by using complex coefficients, and in this way we arrive to the picture of the internal states as elements of $SU(2)$. Indeed, the measured probabilities together with the restrictions of orthonormality of $h$ and $t$ lead us to</p>
$$
h=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} r+\frac{e^{i\alpha}}{\sqrt{2}}g
$$
$$
t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} r-\frac{e^{i\alpha}}{\sqrt{2}}g
$$
<p>If we now measure probabilities respect to $SG_x$ (i.e., probabilities of $b$ and $s$ output when we feed the machine with $h$ or $t$ states) we can find that $\alpha=\pi/2$. That is,</p>
$$
h=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} r+\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}g
$$
$$
t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} r-\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}g
$$
<p>And with some computations we get</p>
$$
SG_y \equiv \begin{pmatrix}
0&-i \\ 
i& 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>The matrices $SG_x, SG_y, SG_z$ are called Pauli matrices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In conclusion, we have a machine, $SG$, that can be oriented in any spatial direction, $\hat{n}$ (unitary vector). When we fix this direction we get a matrix, $SG_{\hat{n}}$, that encodes all the data of the machine (final states, obtained values and probabilities) with this direction. This matrix has two eigenvectors of $\mathbb{C}^2$, $\ket{n+}$ and $\ket{n-}$, that represent the state of the electron after passing through the machine. Or we can think that the device $SG$ is fixed, and we turn the electron gun to a new spatial orientation $\hat{n}$. Internally for the electron this has an effect: if it was at state </p>
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>it is arriving to a new state </p>
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha\\
\beta
\end{pmatrix} \in \mathcal{H}
$$
<p>that can be computed like this:</p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>The rotation of the gun is performed with a $3\times 3$ orthogonal matrix $R\in SO(3)$, that can be viewed as an element of $SU(2)$ (in fact, there are two of them, since it is a double covering).</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>In this assignation we can observe a kind of "miracle". The matrix $R$ can be obtained like the product of other three</li></ul></p>
$$
R=e^{\alpha G_x}\cdot e^{\theta G_y}\cdot e^{\phi G_z}
$$
<p>where $\{G_x, G_y, G_z\}$ are $3\times 3$ matrices forming a basis of $so(3)$. To find the corresponding element of $SU(2)$ we use the isomorphism (as Lie algebras) of $so(3)$ with $su(2)$, and then the exponential map over $SU(2)$. And the miracle is that the images of $G_x,G_y,G_z$ are</p>
$$
\frac{i}{2} SG_x, \frac{i}{2} SG_y,\frac{i}{2} SG_z
$$
<p>although this matrices (without the $i$) appeared like operators to encode data of an observable, not like transformations!!!</p>
<p></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>The obtained element of $SU(2)$ rotates the initial "internal vector" $\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}$ in the usual way: complex matrix product.</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>If we had chosen the other element of $SU(2)$ we would have arrived to other vector in $\mathcal{H}$. But the states are not elements of $\mathcal{H}$, but of $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{H})$.</li></ul></p>
<p></p>
<p>Some considerations to further thoughts:</p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>The element of $SU(2)$ applied in the sandwhich way to the matrices $SG_n$ rotates them, i.e., gives the same result that applying an usual 2x2 rotation matrix on the left. This aims to think the matrices $SG_n$ like vectors...</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>In the point 2 above we watch that $i SG_n$ behaves like bivectors in a Clifford algebra, so here is other reason to think that $SG_n$ are vectors.</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>All would be, therefore, simpler if we forget the Pauli matrices and go to Clifford algebras¿?</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>Explicit computations can be found at mathematica file \textbf{quantum computations SPIN12}</li></ul></p>

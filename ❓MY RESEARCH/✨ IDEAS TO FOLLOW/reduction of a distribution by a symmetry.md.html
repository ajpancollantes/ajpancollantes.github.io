<p>See maple_044 y videos youtube 000 y 001.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The idea is as follows. Given an involutive distribution $\mathcal{Z}=\{A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_r\}$ on an open set of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (with $n>r+1$), and a <a href="./../../♾️ CONCEPTS/GEOMETRY/symmetry of a distribution.md.html">symmetry</a> $X$ (probably it also works with <a href="./../♾️ ❗CONCEPTS/cinf-symmetry of distribution.md.html">cinf-symmetry of distribution</a>) we can use it to pass to a distribution, still of rank $r$, but in a space of dimension $n-1$, preserving the information. <b>The integral manifolds of the reduced distribution would let us obtain the integral manifolds of the original one.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>How do we proceed? We use the invariants of $X$ to construct a projection onto $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. We could also add a variable to this projection in order to do pushforwards and pullbacks properly, if we want.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The vector fields $A_i$ , on their own, are not "projectable" but I think that the whole distribution $\mathcal{Z}$ is projectable, in the sense that although the "pushforwards" (abusing of language) of the vector fields do contain a "strange constant", they span the same distribution that a selected set of $r$ proper vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ (without any "strange constant"). For the moment I only have a "empiric proof" (maple_044).</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, I think that if we express the distribution $\mathcal{Z}$ with $n-r$ differential forms $\omega_i$ such that the first $n-r-1$ contain the symmetry $X$ in their kernel, that is, they are of the form</p>
$$
\omega_i:=\Omega(A_1,\ldots,A_r,X,\ldots,-),\quad i=1,\ldots,n-r-1
$$
<p>then these 1-forms are "projectable" (not defined yet), that is, when we apply the "pullback" they have a factor that can be removed in order to obtain proper 1-forms in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. Again, I have only empirical proof for the moment (this fact is formulated as a lemma, below). These projected 1-forms would describe the reduced distribution. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If we find the integral manifolds of these reduced 1-forms, we can use the "inverse" of the projection to obtain the integral manifolds of the distribution $\{A_1,\ldots,A_r,X\}$, in a way analogous to how we recover the solution of an ODE from the reduced ODE. At the end, we have to integrate one more 1-form, the contraction of $\{A_i\}$ with the volume form of the integral submanifold of $\{A_1,\ldots,A_r,X\}$ inside which we were. If $X$ is a symmetry this 1-form will be closed, and  if $X$ is a cinf-symmetry it will be at least Frobenius integrable. Let's call this "the residual step".</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ideas we were discussing about hidden symmetries should work perfectly in this more general setup. If $X_2$ is a symmetry (cinf-symmetry) of $\mathcal{Z} \cup \{X\}$ such that $X_2$ is also symmetry of $X$ (that is, $X_2$ is projectable) then the projection of $X_2$ along $X$, $\tilde{X}_2$, is a symmetry of the reduced distribution. Observe that $X_2$ is not a symmetry of $\mathcal{Z}$.  Reciprocally, given a symmetry $\tilde{X}_2$ of the reduced distribution (hidden symmetry), there must be a projectable vector field $X_2$, symmetry of $\mathcal{Z} \cup \{X\}$.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Additional considerations:</p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>When $\mathcal{Z}=\{A\}$ is a second order <a href="./../../♾️ CONCEPTS/DEs/ODE.md.html">ODE</a>s and $X$ a symmetry, we are in the case of the classical Lie reduction, or lambdasymmetry reduction.</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>In the case of solvable structures (or cinf-structures) every step in the integration procedure is nothing but the residual step (see above).</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>On the other hand, I think that the "elegant proof" that Paola was looking for, for the transformation of the symmetry of distribution, $X_2$, into the hidden symmetry of the reduced equation, can be achieved if we have the "lemma" for "projectability" 1-forms (see below).</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>These ideas give more meaning to <a href="./partial solvable structure.md.html">partial solvable structure</a>s, because now we could say that a partial solvable structure let us to reduce the "ambient space" of the equation. The problem is that if we use the last element $X_k$ of the partial solvable structure to reduce the distribution $\{...,A_i,\ldots,X_1,\ldots,X_{k-1}\}$ we don't have guarantee that this reduced distribution conserves "the internal structure". (I think we should require $X_k$ to be a cinf-symmetry of all the distributions: $\{\ldots,A_i,\ldots\}$, $\{\ldots,A_i,\ldots,X_1\}$, $\{\ldots,A_i,\ldots,X_1,X_2\}$, ..., and so on)</li></ul></p>

<p><b>Lemma</b></p>
<p>Given an completely integrable <a href="./../../♾️ CONCEPTS/GEOMETRY/Pfaffian system.md.html">Pfaffian system</a> $\mathcal{P}=\{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_{n-r}\}$ on a open set $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and a <a href="./../../♾️ CONCEPTS/GEOMETRY/symmetry of a distribution.md.html#Characteristic_symmetries">characteristic symmetry</a> $X$ of $\mathcal{P}$ (i.e., $X\lrcorner \omega_i=0$ for every $i$), and being</p>
$$
\pi:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1},
$$
<p>a map consisting of the projection on the invariants of $X$, there exist $n-r-1$ independent 1-forms $\tilde{\omega}_i\in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}^{n-1})$ such that</p>
$$
\pi^*(\tilde{\omega}_i)=\sum \eta_{ij} \omega_j
$$
<p>with $\eta_{ij}$ smooth functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$.</p>
<p>$\blacksquare$</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Proof</b></p>
<p><a href="./../../✏️ THEOREMS/DG/Frobenius theorem.md.html">Frobenius theorem</a> let us assure that there exist $n-r$ smooth functions </p>
$$
F_i:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to \mathbb{R}
$$
<p>such that $\mathcal{P}=\{dF_1,\ldots,dF_{n-r}\}$, so there exist also smooth functions $\eta_{ij}$ such that $dF_i=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n-r}\eta_{ij}\omega_j$ (at least in a reduced open set). According to the <a href="./../../✏️ THEOREMS/DG/canonical form of a regular vector field.md.html">canonical form of a regular vector field</a>, there exist a coordinate change</p>
$$
\varphi:(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto(c,z_1,\ldots,z_{n-1})
$$
<p>in such a way that $\varphi_*(X)=\partial_c$. Suppose without lose of generality that</p>
$$
\pi:(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mapsto(z_1,\ldots,z_{n-1}).
$$
<p>Since $X\,\lrcorner\, \omega_j=0$ for every $j$ we have $dF_i(X)=0$, so applying the coordinate change we obtain that $\partial_{c}(F_{i}\circ \varphi^{-1})=0.$ Therefore the 1-forms</p>
$$
\tilde{\omega}_i:=(\varphi^{-1})^*(dF_i)= d(F_{i}\circ \varphi^{-1})
$$
<p>can be projected to the $(z_1,\ldots,z_{n-1})$-space, and so $\pi^*(\tilde{\omega}_i)=\varphi^*(\tilde{\omega}_i)$. And so</p>
$$
\pi^*(\tilde{\omega}_i)=dF_i=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n-r}\eta_{ij}\omega_j
$$
<p>as required.</p>
<p>$\blacksquare$</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Corollary</b></p>
<p>Given a <a href="./../../♾️ CONCEPTS/Frobenius integrable 1-form.md.html">Frobenius integrable 1-form</a> $\omega$ on a open set $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and a vector field $X\in \mbox{Ker}(\omega)$ then, provided that $\pi:U\to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ consist of $n-1$ independent invariants of $X$, there exists a 1-form $\tilde{\omega}$ on $U'\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$  such that</p>
$$
\pi^*(\tilde{\omega})=f\omega.
$$
<p>$\blacksquare$</p>
<p></p>
<p>That is: this 1-form can be projected.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, I think that Corollary 2.3. in <a href="./../../Bibliography/@bryant2013exterior.md.html">@bryant2013exterior</a> is a particular case of this lemma. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Main result</b></p>
<p>Given an involutive <a href="./../../♾️ CONCEPTS/GEOMETRY/distribution.md.html">distribution</a> $\mathcal{Z}$ on an open set $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and a <a href="./../../♾️ CONCEPTS/GEOMETRY/symmetry of a distribution.md.html">symmetry</a> $X$ there exist:</p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>an open set $\tilde{U}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.</li></ul></p>
<p><ul style="margin-left:0px;"><li>an involutive distribution $\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}$ on $\tilde{U}$.</li></ul></p>
<p>such that if the integral manifold of $\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}$ through $\varphi(p)\in \tilde{U}$ it is known then the integral manifold of $\mathcal{Z}$ through $p$ can be obtained by a quadrature.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Proof</b></p>
<p>Idea: </p>
<p>Construct the map $\varphi: U\to \tilde{U}$ with the invariants of $X$. </p>
<p>Construct $\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}$ with the lemma.</p>
<p>Once the integral manifold of $\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}$ through $\varphi(p)\in \tilde{U}$ is known, say $\tilde{N}$, then the integral manifold of $\mathcal{Z}$ through $p$ is contained in $\varphi^{-1}(\tilde{N})$. The 1-form not used for the projection (the one which doesn't contain $X$) should be the 1-form to integrate in order to get the solution.</p>
<p>$\blacksquare$</p>
<p></p>
<p>Variation: if instead of requiring $X$ to be a symmetry we require only to be a <a href="./../♾️ ❗CONCEPTS/cinf-symmetry of distribution.md.html">cinf-symmetry of distribution</a> then the integral manifold is obtained by a Pfaffian equation.</p>
